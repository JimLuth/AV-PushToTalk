# AV-PushToTalk

A/V Push-to-Talk AutoHotKey script for Video Conference apps (Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet ...) 

## Motivation

I spend hours in video conferences and wanted to have a global key assigned the would in unison toggle my mic and camera on and off no matter which window had the focus.  I also wanted this to work optionally in "push-to-talk" mode where pressing the key down performs one toggle and letting the key up performs the toggle again.

## Prerequisites

The script currently works with the following video conferencing services  both as Windows apps and in a browser as noted.

| Service         | Windows app | Web Browser |
| --------------- |:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Blue Jeans      |             | **$√$**     |
| Google Meet     | N/A         | **$√$**     |
| GoToMeeting     | **$√$**     | **$√$**     |
